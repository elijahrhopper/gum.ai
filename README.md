## Overview

gum.AI is an application powered by artificial intelligence and computer vision focused on helping people take control of their dental hygiene by automatically detecting a number of common conditions.

Currently, the only functionality the app supports is detecting whether or not the user has bulimia.  The user inputs a picture taken of their teeth and the CV algorithm returns whether or not the patient has bulimia and its confidence metric.
